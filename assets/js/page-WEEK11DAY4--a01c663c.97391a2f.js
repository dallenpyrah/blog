I really feel like I found the thing I was looking for which is coding and I've developed a real passion for it. I would have loved if this course was longer but things always have to come to an end. I don't really have any concerns, one thing I would have loved to learn in the course was information about using a major cloud service like AWS, Azure, or Googles Cloud Platform. I feel like it would have given me a big advantage in the workforce. After the course ends I plan on sticking to the same schedule I was doing at codeworks with adjustments rather then having a lecture in the morning I would focus on interview questions, whiteboard questions, and looking for jobs. In the afternoon I will be taking time to code my projects for which I already have a couple planned out. The thing I've enjoyed most about the course is the people I got to be around. I've loved every part of the course but being able to meet new people and become closer to them is something I really value exspecially with covid since I didn't really get to see anyone. I look forward to graduating and meeting more software developers who have the same drive and passion.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
