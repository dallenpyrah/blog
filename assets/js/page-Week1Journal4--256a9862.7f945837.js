The second level is the most common with mid-fidelity wire frames, this allows us to create a mock design of a website and go more into the detial of it unlike the lower level. A mid-fidelity wire frame would most likely be created in an application like Figma which is what we used today. This allows us to get the dimesions of the screen correct and also create multiple page layouts that makes it easy to carry similiar elements page to page. Once we get to a high-fidelity wire frame we start adding in the fine detials of the webpage we are building. For example rounding the edges on a card, or changing the colors within that card so that they are contrasting creating a look that pops out of the page.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("The best way to think about all of these are low-fidelty wire frames are something the can be sketched out, mid-fidelty wire frames are an outline of where everything would be, and high-fidelty wire frames are when we go in an finish out all the fine detials offering a stunning and polished website proto-type.")]),e._v(" "),a("ol",{attrs:{start:"3"}},[a("li",[e._v("Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require?

Then when we get done with wire frame, we have a visual representation of what we want our website to look like. It's splitting the job into sections rather than trying to take it all on at once.
