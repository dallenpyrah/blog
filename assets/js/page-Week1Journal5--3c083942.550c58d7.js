It's a great way to learn something rather than having a bunch of information I have to memorize in order to pass a test. That's what I was hoping to happen when I came to this school, I really wanted to learn about coding not just memorize terms. So far they've done a great job at that which I appreciate. Building these real world projects I believe will get me ready to becoem a software developer faster than anything else could. The only thing I was struggling with this week was nested rows, but the more I studied it and applied it in projects I understood them better and by the time Friday came around all my questions around them were answered.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
