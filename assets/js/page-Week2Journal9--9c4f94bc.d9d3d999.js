If that doesn't work reach out to some of your other softare developer friends and co-workers to see if they can help you with your problem.

Now there will still be times where our stubborness may lead us into making those same mistakes but at least we know where we wen't wrong. The biggest takeaways for me, were looking something up or asking for help rather than sitting trying to solve the same problem by yourself for hours. I need to get better at asking for help, but I am glad because it helps me grow in my career and my life. Another take away was taking breaks, I know during our morning lectures they have us take 10 min breaks but I am use to working in a fast food restraunt and most of the time we would only have one 30 min break a day. With coding our brain is trying to solve complex problems and if we are always trying to force it to do something without giving it a little break we will struggle to find the solution.")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("https://github.com/dallenpyrah/slap-game")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
