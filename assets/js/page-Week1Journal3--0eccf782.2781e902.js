It visually makes the pages look a whole lot better without actually changing the size of the elements.")]),e._v(" "),o("ol",{attrs:{start:"2"}},[o("li",[e._v("Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.")])]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("Cheating at design is a create resource to start with that will give us a solid foundation, I do believe that there are some other websites that we can utilize in order to create a more stunning website as well.
